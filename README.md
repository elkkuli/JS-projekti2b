### Why and how the thing works?

This is a project for a Javascript course. 

The assingment was to build an app by using jQuery. I used Bored Api's open source api // https://www.boredapi.com/.

It should be able to do the following:

* If you're bored, the app gives you different options for different kind of activities to do. 
* You can choose among <i>education, recreational, social, diy, charity, cooking, relaxation, music,</i> and <i> busywork.</i>
* I also wanted to play with different jQuery events like slideToggle, animate and fadeTo.
